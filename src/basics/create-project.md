# Create a Rust project

Smart contracts are Rust library crates. We will start with creating one:

```shell
$ cargo new --lib ./contract
```

You created a simple Rust library, but it is not yet ready to be a smart contract.
The first thing to do is to update the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "contract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2.0.4", features = ["staking"] }
sylvia = "1.1.0"
schemars = "0.8.16"
cosmwasm-schema = "2.0.4"
serde = { version = "1.0.198", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
```

As you can see, I added a `crate-type` field for the library section.
Generating the [`cdylib`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html) is
required to create a proper web assembly binary.
The downside of this is that such a library cannot be used as a dependency
for other Rust crates - for now, it is not needed, but later we will show
how to approach reusing contracts as dependencies.

Additionally, we added some core dependencies for smart contracts:
- [`cosmwasm-std`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/1.3.1/cosmwasm_std/) - Crate that is a
standard library for smart contracts. It provides essential utilities for communication with the
outside world, helper functions, and types. Every smart contract we will build will
use this dependency.
- [`sylvia`](https://docs.rs/sylvia/latest/sylvia/) - Crate, we will learn in this
book. It provides us with three procedural macros: `entry_points`, `contract` and `interface`.
I will expand on them later in the book. 
- [`schemars`](https://docs.rs/schemars/0.8.12/schemars/index.html) - Crate used to create JSON
schema documents for our contracts. It is automatically derived on types generated by
^sylvia and will be later used to provide concise API for blockchain users, who might not be Rust developers.
- [`cosmwasm-schema`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-schema/1.3.1/cosmwasm_schema/) - Similar to `schemars`.
This crate expands on `schemars` and provides us with trait 
[`QueryResponses`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-schema/1.3.1/cosmwasm_schema/trait.QueryResponses.html) 
which ties query variants to their responses. I will expand on that later in the book.
- [`serde`](https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.180/serde/) - Framework for serializing and deserializing
Rust data structures efficiently and generically.
