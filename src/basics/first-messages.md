# Generating first messages

We have already created a simple contract reacting to an `Empty` message on instantiate. Unfortunately, it
is not very useful. Let's make it a bit reactive.

## Updating dependencies

First we need to add [`sylvia`](https://crates.io/crates/sylvia) and some other crates to our project.

```toml
[package]
name = "contract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = { version = "1.1", features = ["staking"] }
cosmwasm-schema = "1.1.6"
serde = { version = "1.0.147", features = ["derive"] }
sylvia = "0.2.1"
schemars = "0.8.11"
```

We had to add also some more dependencies required for generated by `sylvia` code to compile:

- [`cosmwasm-schema`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-schema/latest/cosmwasm_schema/) - we will later rely
  on this dependency to generate API schema of our contract.
- [`serde`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/) - very important framework for serializing and
  deserializing Rust data structures. It is crucial as serialization is required for messages to be
  sent from and to the `contract`.
- [`schemars`](https://docs.rs/schemars/latest/schemars/) - it will be also required later when
  will deal with generating schema of our API.

## Creating instantiation message

For this step we will create new file:

- `src/contract.rs` - here we will define our messages and behavior of the contract upon receiving them

Add this module to `src/lib.rs`. You want it to be public as users might want to get access to
types stored inside your contract.

```rust,noplayground
pub mod contract;

use cosmwasm_std::{entry_point, DepsMut, Empty, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};

#[entry_point]
pub fn instantiate(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: Empty,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::new())
}
```

Now let's create `instantiate` method for our contract. In `src/contract.rs`

```rust,noplayground
use cosmwasm_std::{DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};
use schemars;
use sylvia::contract;

pub struct AdminContract {}

pub type ContractError = cosmwasm_std::StdError;

#[contract]
impl AdminContract {
    #[msg(instantiate)]
    pub fn instantiate(&self, _ctx: (DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo)) -> StdResult<Response> {
        Ok(Response::new())
    }
}
```

So what is going on here? First we define Admin struct. It is empty right now but later when we will
learn about states and its fields will be used to store them.
We introduce alias `ContractError` which is required by `sylvia`. Later we will create our custom
`ContractError`, but for now it is enough to just alias the
[`cosmwasm_std::StdError`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/enum.StdError.html).
Notice it is marked as `pub` as we want to it to be accessible in other modules.
Next we create `impl` block for `Admin` and invoke `contract `attribute macro from `sylvia`. It will
generate a lot of boilerplate for us regarding messages generation and their dispatch. It will also
make sure that none of the messages overlap and will catch it on compile time.
Then there is a method instantiate which currently doesn't do much.
What's important here is the `#[msg(instantiate)]`. `contract` macro will parse through the method
and basing on it's structure generate InstantiateMsg with parameters equal to ones declared in
`instantiate` method past `_ctx`. F.e. this will generate among others

```rust,noplayground
impl AdminContract {
    pub fn instantiate(
        &self,
        _ctx: (DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo),
    ) -> StdResult<Response> {
        Ok(Response::new())
    }
}
#[allow(clippy::derive_partial_eq_without_eq)]
#[derive(
    sylvia::serde::Serialize,
    sylvia::serde::Deserialize,
    Clone,
    Debug,
    PartialEq,
    sylvia::schemars::JsonSchema,
)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {}

impl InstantiateMsg {
    pub fn dispatch(
        self,
        contract: &AdminContract,
        ctx: (
            cosmwasm_std::DepsMut,
            cosmwasm_std::Env,
            cosmwasm_std::MessageInfo,
        ),
    ) -> StdResult<Response> {
        let Self {} = self;
        contract.instantiate(ctx.into()).map_err(Into::into)
    }
}
```

Let's focus on instantiate right now. As you can see struct InstantiateMsg with all needed derives
is being generated for you. Most important are
[`Serialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Serialize.html)
and [`Deserialize`](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Deserialize.html)
There is also `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` which is not important for now.

Sylvia also generates `dispatch` method for every msg linking it with user specifed behavior. One of
it's argument is `AdminContract` on which the message should be dispatch. Let's create `new` method
so that we will be able to use it in our entry point.

`src/contract.rs`

```rust,noplayground
use cosmwasm_std::{DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};
use schemars;
use sylvia::contract;

pub struct AdminContract {}

pub type ContractError = cosmwasm_std::StdError;

#[contract]
impl AdminContract {
    pub const fn new() -> AdminContract {
        AdminContract {}
    }

    #[msg(instantiate)]
    pub fn instantiate(&self, _ctx: (DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo)) -> StdResult<Response> {
        Ok(Response::new())
    }
}
```

Great, now we can modify the `src/lib.rs`

```rust,noplayground
pub mod contract;

use cosmwasm_std::{entry_point, DepsMut, Empty, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};

use crate::contract::{InstantiateMsg, AdminContract};

const CONTRACT: AdminContract = AdminContract::new();

#[entry_point]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    msg.dispatch(&CONTRACT, (deps, env, info))
}
```

We have created `const CONTRACT` on which the instantiation will be called.
`Empty` is now changed to `InstantiateMsg` generated by sylvia. We call `dispatch on it which call defined by us in `src/contract.rs\` implementation.
For now it is just returning empty Response, but let's change it in next chapters introducing states
and queries.
