# Introduction

This book is a guide for creating CosmWasm smart contracts with the Sylvia framework.
It will lead you step by step and explain relevant topics from easiest to trickiest.

The idea of the book is not only to tell you about smart contract development but also
to show you how to do it clean and maintainable. I will show you some good practices
for using `sylvia`.

This book is not meant to teach you about the `CosmWasm`. To learn about that, I recommend reading
[the cosmwasm-book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).

This book covers `sylvia` in version 0.7.0.

## Prerequirements

This book explores CosmWasm smart contracts. It is not a Rust tutorial, and it
assumes basic Rust knowledge. As you will probably learn it alongside this
book, I recommend first grasping the language. You can find
great resources to start with Rust on [Learn
Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) page.

## CosmWasm API documentation

This is the guide-like documentation. If you are looking for the API
documentation, you may be interested in checking one of the following:
