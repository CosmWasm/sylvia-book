# Introduction

This book is a guide for creating [CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm) **smart contracts**
using [Sylvia](https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia) framework.
It will guide you step by step, explaining relevant topics from the easiest to the trickiest ones.

The idea of the book is not only to tell you about smart contract development but also
to show you how to do it clean and maintainable. I will show you some good practices
for using [Sylvia](https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia).

This book is not meant to teach you about the [CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm).
To learn about that, read [The CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com).

This book covers [Sylvia](https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia) in version 0.7.0.

## Prerequisites

This book explores [CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm) **smart contracts**.
It is not intended to be a Rust tutorial, and it assumes a basic Rust knowledge.
As you will probably learn it alongside this book, I recommend first grasping the language.
You can find great resources to start with Rust on [Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) page.

## CosmWasm API documentation

This is the guide-like documentation. If you are looking for the API documentation,
